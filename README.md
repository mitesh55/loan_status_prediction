# loan_status_prediction
prediction of loan approval status base on applicant details.

# skewnwess :
to make distribution or skewness normal we can remove outliers or can apply different transformations (eg. log , square, etc..).

# EDA :
in EDA analysis has been done on each feature to get idea about how it has impact on target variable.

# Feature Engineering :
in FE part, we made few new features like TotalIncome, EMi and Capacity to get relevent idea to predict loan status consigering interest rate of 7.5 %.

# Model Building :
in this project of model building we used 10 different algorithms 
1), Logistic Regression
2), Decision Tree
3), Random Forest
4), Xtreme Gradient Boosting
5), Bagging Classifier
6), Stochastic Gradient Descent
7), k-means Clustering
8), Support Vector Machine
9), Multi Nomial Naive Bayes
10), Extra Tree Classifier

# Model Evaluation :
After appying above algorithms, i got accuracy of 79.16 % while checked on Analytics Vidhya's Loan status prediction project.
